    <p>Hi! My name is Stefano, and I'm on a mission to learn as much 
 as I can about computer science. That's why I'm taking <a href=https://codehs.com/student/1258809/section/87808/assignments>Web design</a>
 with CodeHS!</p>
 
    <p>I started off with learning HTML and CSS. That's how I made my very own homepage!
      You can make your own homepage as well! 
      Simply go to the CodeHS <a href=https://codehs.com/editor/sandbox>Sandbox</a>
     , and click the edit Homepage button:</p>   
    
    <p>Any HTML code you write will be hosted at your very own <a href=https://codehs.com/editor/html/415430/1258809/index.html>Subdomain</a>
      on the codehs.me domain. For example, mine is calvin.codehs.me</p>
    
    <p>This is a publicly visible URL, so you can 
      easily share your homepage with friends and family
      by sending them a link!</p>

    <h1>About my Homepage</h1>
    
    <p>As I go through the CodeHS Web Design course, I'll be 
    updating my homepage with all of my latest creative projects.At the end 
    of the course I'll have a full portfolio of computational artifacts!</p>
